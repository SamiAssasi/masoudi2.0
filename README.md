This is my own personal project, I did this a few years back with just basic React, but now I'm trying to do it better hence the name Masoudi 2.0.

Masoudi is created with Gatsby which is a React framework. I don't actually need CMS for this project, but I've still decided to use Contentful to be more familiar with it and also for GraphQL testing purposes. 

Masoudi is my mothers last name and hopefully in the future my own consulting agency will be called by this name as well.
